Small hangman project to practive java coding and learn how to use a web parser in this case Jsoup.


Main Goals:
Practice java by implementing working game that allows for multiple playthroughs: COMPLETED
Use Jsoup to pull random word from the internet in order to be used in a game of hangman

Current proggress 
Game works for built in list of words.  The current obstacle is being able to pull the correct information
from the website.  Most websites that I have found the generate words have these words inside of a 
script or button.  I am having trouble pulling the word itself and not the html from the element that
contains it.  For the future I will continue to try and figure my way around the html or possibly rethink
the kind of website to pull from.


Some secondary stretch goals that I hope to implement in the future in no particular order:
1.GUI based version
2.Different difficulty levels, different kinds of words selected
3.Different themes to select (like sports, movies, videogames, animals)
