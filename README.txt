Small hangman project to practive java coding.

Some goals that I hope to implement in the future in no particular order:

1. Successful looping of the game to allow for multiple playthroughs
2. Pull word from online (maybe dictionary.com or similar website) instead of built in list of words
3. Function textbased game and GUI based version
4. Different difficulty levels, different kinds of words selected
5. Different themes to select (like sports, movies, videogames, animals)
